It looks like you've successfully added debugging statements to the FFT 
function, and it's executing as expected, doubling the size of the input 
vector until it reaches a power of two, then performing the FFT process 
recursively. The output you've provided shows the function is called with 
increasing vector sizes, following the expected doubling pattern until it 
processes the entire data set, then it unwinds back as each call completes.

This is a correct and expected behavior for the FFT algorithm, 
especially in a recursive implementation where each call splits the 
dataset into smaller chunks (even and odd elements), processes them 
individually, and then combines them back together.

The completion messages for each vector size indicate that the algorithm 
progresses through all stages without getting indefinitely stuck, which 
means the recursion is functioning correctly. If the process seems to 
take longer than expected for large datasets, this might simply be due 
to the computational complexity of the FFT, especially when the data 
size becomes large.

Based on your output, there doesn't seem to be an issue with the recursion 
itself or the function getting stuck. If you're experiencing performance 
issues, consider verifying the efficiency of other parts of your code or 
he complexity of the data being processed. The FFT algorithm's computational 
complexity is O(nlog⁡n)O(nlogn), so large datasets can significantly increase 
processing time.

FACTOR ON HOW LONG IT TAKES TO RUN

Size of the Data Set: The complexity of FFT is O(nlog⁡n)O(nlogn), 
where nn is the number of data points. So, the time to run will 
increase with the size of the data set, but not linearly—rather, 
it grows in proportion to nlog⁡nnlogn.

Hardware: The processing power of the computer (CPU speed, RAM availability, 
etc.) will significantly affect execution time.

The time it takes to run a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on an image depends 
on several factors including the size of the image (number of pixels), 
the efficiency of the implementation, and the hardware it's running on. 
The FFT algorithm has a computational complexity of O(nlog⁡n)O(nlogn), 
where nn is the number of data points. For an image, if you're performing 
a 2D FFT, this operation is typically applied separately to the rows and 
columns, making the total complexity O(nlog⁡n+mlog⁡m)O(nlogn+mlogm) for an 
n×mn×m image.
